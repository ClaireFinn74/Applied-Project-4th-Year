## Applied-Project-4th-Year

# Description:
A C# Application for my 4th year project as part of a team.
Within this project we are going to create a Brain Training-Type game called BrainWorks. Within this game we have 4 different areas of learning: Attention, Problem-Solving, Memory and Speed.

Within Attention you will find 5 games that are aimed at improving your attention:

1. Everything has a Porpoise: Within this game, you will start off with 3 Porpoise images which will be swimming around the screen via a storyboard operation. The user has to tap all of the porpoise to advance in levels. The score will implement by 1 every time the user clicks a Porpoise. If the user clicks the porpoise more than once, the game will end. All the porpoise look the same so the game is supposed to test if the user is paying attention to the porpoise's positions on the screen. As the levels increase, a porpoise is added to the bunch until there are enough to confuse the user into paying attention to the game!
2. Picture Perfect: Within this game, the user will chooce an enlarged picture, the picture should be studied carefully. When the user clicks the begin button, they will be navigated to a page that has 10 textboxes with the names of objects within the picture written on them. The user has to choose every object that was in the previous picture they have studied. When the user chooses an option, the textbox that had the item name written on it disappears (txtbox.Visibility.Collapsed) until all objects have been clicked. If the user picks an incorrect object, they will be brought back to the mainpage, otherwise the user will progress in levels.
3. Total Recall:The user will be presented with a textbox. The textbox has the first few letters of a word, for example 'Ac' written into it. The user then has to input the rest of the word (if they can think of one!) to increment the score. The user can input as many words as they can think of as long as these words are input before the timer runs out! The words can only be valid words that are included in the list (valid words from 3-9 letters in length straight from the dictionary). A random array of lists will decide which letters the word will start with. The game will require the user to think of a certain number of words that have 3 letters, 4 letters and so on until 9 letters to increase the score.
